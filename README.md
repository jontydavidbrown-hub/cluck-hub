- Removed popup alerts; Save button now flashes **Saved âœ…** briefly.
- Reminders page restored.
- Dashboard tiles keep % inside the progress bar and Add Weights / Add Morts buttons.
- Feed & Silos supports exact-tonnage deliveries and per-shed breakdowns.
- Daily Log supports per-shed mort types and shows totals + % vs birds placed.
